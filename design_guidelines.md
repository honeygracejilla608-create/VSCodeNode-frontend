# Design Guidelines - Todo API Project

## Project Context

This is a **backend REST API project** without a user-facing visual interface. The application consists of:

- JWT-protected HTTP endpoints
- JSON request/response format
- Server-side task management
- Email notification system

## No Visual Design Required

**This project does not require visual design guidelines** because it is:

1. **A REST API service** - No HTML, CSS, or visual components
2. **JSON-based communication** - Responses are data structures, not UI elements
3. **Server-side only** - No frontend, no pages, no user interface
4. **CLI/curl interaction** - Used via HTTP clients, not browsers

## API Response Format Guidelines

Since this is an API, the only "design" considerations are:

**JSON Response Structure:**
- Consistent error format: `{ "error": "message" }`
- Successful responses: Return the created/requested resource
- HTTP status codes: 200 (success), 201 (created), 401 (unauthorized), 400 (bad request)

**API Documentation Format:**
- Clear endpoint descriptions
- Request/response examples
- Authentication requirements

## If Frontend Is Added Later

Should you decide to build a frontend interface for this API in the future, design guidelines would then focus on:
- Todo list visualization
- Task creation forms
- Authentication flows
- Dashboard layouts

**Current scope: This is a backend-only project with no visual design requirements.**
